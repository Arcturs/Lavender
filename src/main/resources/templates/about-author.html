                <p>Hi, my name is Nastya!</p>
                <p>I'm currently taking my bachelors degree in software engineering. This website was made as
                my pet project before making a final one for DataArt Java School.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>If you're interested in my other projects, welcome to my github!</p>
                <p>Here some interesting facts about me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maybe it's not obvious, however my level in english is C1. I've been studying in
                    international language school in Bath, England for two weeks. Currently I'm studying Italian.</li>
                    <li>I'm that one type of people who prefers to walk a long distance rather than
                    take a bus.</li>
                    <li>I'm interested in studying machine learning. Also I've made couple of projects on python.</li>
                </ul>
